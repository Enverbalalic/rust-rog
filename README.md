This is a project to support the ASUS ROG mice on linux.
It is done through reverse engineering and so far it has been tested on an ROG Keris Wireless.
This is in no way affiliated with ASUS.

Shoutout to https://github.com/kyokenn/rogdrv project for great work reverse engineering the protocol for this.
That didn't work for me since the protocol seems to have changed slightly.
If `rust-rog` this doesn't work for you, you might want to look at `rogdrv` instead since it implements a slightly different protocol.
